<h2> About </h2>
<p> I’m Kirtan Desai I’m currently a sophomore at UTSA, majoring in cybersecurity. My experience consists of working as an intern at Code2College Labs as a programmer of multiple languages and my other internship as a Financial Operations intern at BigCommerce. The skills and knowledge I taken away from these experiences allows me to be a worker that endeavors to help increase productivity and collaboration in my future career.  I’m hardworking, driven, and a quick thinker about the problem in front of me in a work environment. </p>
